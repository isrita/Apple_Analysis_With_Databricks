# 🚀 AppleAnalysis - Data Engineering Project

Welcome to the **AppleAnalysis** repository! This project is a **data analysis pipeline** built using **PySpark** to process and analyze structured and unstructured datasets efficiently. The pipeline leverages **Databricks, Azure, and Spark** to perform ETL operations, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
📁 appleanalysis
│── 📄 data_ingestion.ipynb       # Notebook for raw data ingestion
│── 📄 data_cleaning.ipynb        # Notebook for data preprocessing and cleaning
│── 📄 feature_engineering.ipynb  # Notebook for creating features from raw data
│── 📄 analysis.ipynb             # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
│── 📄 pipeline.py                # PySpark pipeline script for batch processing
│── 📄 requirements.txt           # List of dependencies for the project
│── 📄 README.md                  # Project Documentation
```

Each notebook:
- Contains **detailed instructions** for executing each phase of the analysis.
- Implements **PySpark transformations** to clean, process, and extract insights from data.
- Uses **Azure Databricks** and **Spark clusters** to manage big data efficiently.
- Produces **visual reports** for better data-driven decision-making.

## 📥 How to Import and Run This Project in Databricks

To execute this pipeline in your **Databricks** environment, follow these steps:

### **1️⃣ Download the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/appleanalysis.git
```

Or manually **download the ZIP** from GitHub and extract the files.

---

### **2️⃣ Open Databricks and Navigate to the Workspace**
1. Log in to **Databricks Community Edition** ([Sign In Here](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/)) or your enterprise workspace.
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Workspace**.
3. Select a directory where you want to import the notebooks.

---

### **3️⃣ Import the Notebooks into Databricks**
You can import the notebooks using one of the following methods:

#### **Option 1: Import One Notebook at a Time**
1. Click on the **Dropdown (▼) next to your target folder**.
2. Select **Import**.
3. Choose **"File"** and upload a single `.ipynb` or `.py` notebook from the downloaded folder.
4. Click **Import** to add it to your workspace.

#### **Option 2: Import All Notebooks as a Folder (DBC File)**
If you've exported the entire repository as a `.dbc` file:
1. Go to **Workspace**.
2. Click **Import**.
3. Select **"File"** and upload the `.dbc` archive.
4. Databricks will automatically extract all notebooks into a new folder.

---

### **4️⃣ Run the Pipeline**
1. Open the **data_ingestion.ipynb** notebook and execute it first to load raw data.
2. Run the **data_cleaning.ipynb** to preprocess and clean the data.
3. Execute **feature_engineering.ipynb** to transform data and create new features.
4. Finally, run **analysis.ipynb** to visualize results and gain insights.
5. (Optional) Execute **pipeline.py** as a batch job in Databricks for large-scale processing.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- Ensure your **Databricks cluster is running** before executing any notebook.
- If you experience **import errors**, check the **requirements.txt** and install missing libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- For **large datasets**, ensure your cluster has sufficient memory and optimize partitioning in Spark.
